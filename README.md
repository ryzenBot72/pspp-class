# PSPP Class Archive 🗂️

This repository is an **archive of my PSPP (Problem Solving and Programming in C)** coursework from my **[Semester 1, Year 2024]**.  
It contains my **lab assignments, practice codes, and a final project**.  

I’m making this repo public to **show my coding journey** — from my early C programs to more structured projects.  
It’s not actively maintained, but preserved for learning and reference.
